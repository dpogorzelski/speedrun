Speedrun helps you control your compute fleet with minimal effort.

Example, stop nginx across 3k machines:

```bash
speedrun service stop nginx --target "Labels.role == 'nginx'"
```

Features:

* stateless
* serverless
* idempotent
* no complex configuration required
* service discovery via native cloud integration (currently Google Cloud only, AWS, Azure and Consul coming up!)
* extensible (plugin system is in the works)

## Motivation
This project satisfies a simple need: to be able to perform certain type of operations, such as a service restart, occasionally and on a large number of machines. It should allow you, the SRE/DevOps person, to act on a large scale infrastructure in case of immediate need. The solution attempts to be simple to use, require little maintenance and be easy to configure. It's inspired by Saltstack's execution modules.

## Installation

#### MacOS, Linux, Windows

Download the precompiled binaries from here: [Releases](https://github.com/dpogorzelski/speedrun/releases)

## Usage

#### Quickstart

On a server:

```bash
sudo ./portal --insecure
```

On your machine:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/serviceaccount.json
speedrun init
speedrun run whoami --insecure
```

## Architecture

</p>

#### Speedrun
Speedrun is the client. Speedrun is the CLI tool you run on your computer to send commands to your servers.

#### Portal
Portal is the agent running on each server you want to send commands to. It will receive commands sent from Speedrun and respond with the outcome details accordingly.
#### Service Discovery
There is no server component in Speedrun's architecture. Service discovery is performed against native facilities of each supported provider such as GCP,AWS or Consul.
This eliminates the need to deploy,maintain and operate a server and all problems that would come with it as a consequence, such as: scalability, failure tolerance, redundancy, agent lifecycle management etc.

#### Protocols

Communication between Speedrun and Portals is performed via [dRPC](https://github.com/storj/drpc), a lightweight, drop-in replacement for gRPC. All dRPC interactions travel on top of TLS1.3 and can be mutually authenticated ([mTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication)).

#### Language Definition
Speedrun supports a flexible yet simple expression language to filter Service Discovery results (`--target`), it's based on [antonmedv/expr](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr). Full language definition can be found [here](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/master/docs/Language-Definition.md).

#### Plugins
TODO

## Examples

Stop Nginx on VMs that have a label `role` with value `nginx` and a label named `project` with value `someproject`

```bash
speedrun service stop nginx --target "labels.role == 'nginx' and labels.project == 'someproject'"
```

Run arbitrary shell command on the target machines. Ignore Portal's certificate and connect via private IP address.

```bash
speedrun run "ls -la" --target "labels.env != 'prod'" --insecure --use-private-ip
```

Use a different config file

```bash
speedrun run whoami -c /path/to/config.toml
```

## Configuration

Instead of supplying certain flags repeatedly you can persist their behavior in the config file. Default config file is located at `~/.speedrun/config.toml` and default settings can be fetched via `speedrun init --print`.

#### Run portal as a systemd unit
TODO

#### Use self signed certificates during testing
In the [scripts](scripts/) folder you can find scripts that will help you generate:
* a CA cert/key
* Speedrun cert/key
* Portal cert/key

TODO

## List of built-in Actions
* [x] run: run arbitrary shell commands
* [X] service: control systemd services
* [ ] file: perform file operations such as read or tail
* [ ] disk: perform storage operations such as listing partitions and available disk space
* [ ] ps: fetch process information
* [ ] top: fetch or stream high level system stats
* [ ] pkg: manage packages via default package manager
* [ ] system: host control operations such as reboot, shutdown etc.
